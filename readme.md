### Java II Android Projects

These are the projects and assignments for my Java II class of my senior year in high school. Java II is where I first learned Android development.

This repository includes assignments and projects and I have worked on during the semester, and since the start, I have taught myself the fundamentals of Android development, as well as learning to navigate around an Android project efficiently.
